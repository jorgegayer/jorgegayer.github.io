        <h2>When did I see Ana for the first time?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          I remember when I was a young man, (not that far, ok?), sat on my
          living room couch and watching the Olympic games in 1996, mainly
          volleyball, the sport I like the most, and observing the strength of a
          woman’s attack and thinking “God, she is strong”. She was incredible!
          Even having 1.85cm of height, she could jump so high and attack so
          strong, finding holes on the wall mounted by the opponent defense so
          cleverly… I was barely believing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is basically how I met Ana. I know, you might be thinking I am
          not a huge sports fan, right? You are right. If I were more inclined
          to sports, I would probably know beforehand that to be at the
          Olympics, Ana, the Brazilian team’s captain of the game I was
          watching, was previously World Coup Champion, Coup of the Champions
          champion, Pan-American Champion and many others. I would know also
          that she, at that time, was already considered one of the strongest
          services on volleyball, having even a Service of 106Km/h, speed only
          seen on masculine category before. <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ok, I was impressed, and I was not even aware of the big picture. I
          did not know how many years she fought to be there, the challenges and
          the frustrations. I remember that Brazil was Bronze on the volleyball
          category in the Olympics that year. I remember to see her crying on
          her knees and the entire team coming to hug her. That is a kind of
          inspirational scene that makes us cry together, proud to fight, to try
          every single day and do not give up. That scene was unforgettable.<br />

        <h2>How is Ana today?</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          Well, I know that reading numbers and achievements do not bring the
          real history and sometimes resume a lifetime of work in numbers. That
          is cold, poor and little.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was zapping the television some years after that (yes, years) and in
          one of the channels I saw a woman on a suit, standing up behind what
          seemed to be a meeting table of an important corporation and I
          recognized her. It was Ana. More impressive than that, reading the
          show name she was participating I was choked. It was the Brazilian
          version of The Apprentice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Well, ok I thought, let us see more of that. In 30 minutes, I was
          impressed again. She was serious but kind, confident but open, smart
          but humble, I needed to watch more. I quickly went to the internet and
          found on YouTube the entire season to watch and that is what I did.
          From the beginning of the show to the end, she was brilliant and all I
          can say to prove that would be not enough.<br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was watching the show with the same enthusiasm I had for the games.
          Well, It was more than what I had for the games because there I could
          know another Ana. I learned there that from the period she retired
          from the games until now, Ana is working mainly on beneficent and
          social projects. <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ana founded IEE (Instituto Educação e Esporte), the Sport-Education
          institute. She is being working since there to develop children
          education through sports, teaching and bringing values like honesty,
          perseverance, ethics, democracy, humanism, and commitment to daily
          education, using the sport as an education instrument. There I could
          know another Ana and I invite you to know her better and her project
          too. Ah, by the way. Ana won the show (why is this not a surprise?)
          and the 1 million Reais prize. The prize was donated to a Cerebral
          Palsy institute in Brazil (yes, not a surprise as well). .<br />

        <p>
          My name is Jorge Gayer and I am studying software development at Bow
          Valley College. This page is a part of an assignment where we needed
          to produce a webpage about an sportist we admire. Who knows me know
          that I am not a huge sport fan, but I am absolutely a person fan. This
          is a humble and simple tribute to Ana Moser.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may observe this page and see a lot of room for improvement, I am
          completetly sure about that. But for me this really represents a
          begining of a journey I am very proud and willing to follow.
