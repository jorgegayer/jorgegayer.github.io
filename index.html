        <p><strong>How did I see Ana the first time?</strong><br>
        I remember when I was a kid, (not that far, ok?), sat on my living room couch and watching the Olympic games, mainly volleyball, the sport I like the most, and observing the strength of a woman’s attack and thinking “god, she is strong”. She was incredible. Even having 1.85cm of height, she could jump so high and attack so strong, finding holes on the wall mounted by the opponent defense so cleverly… I was barely believing.  
        This is basically how I met Ana. I know, not a huge sports fan, right? If I was more inclined to sports, I would probably know previously that to be there, Ana, the team captain of the game I was watching, was previously World Coup Champion, Coup of the Champions champion, Pan-American Champion and many others. I would know also that she, at that time, was already considered one of the strongest services on volleyball, having even a Service of 106Km/h, speed only seen on masculine category before. 
        Ok, I was impressed, and I was not even aware of the big picture. I did not know how many years she fought to be there, the challenges and the frustrations. I remember that Brazil was Bronze on the volleyball category in the Olympics that year. I remember to see her crying on knees and the entire team coming to hug her. That is a kind of inspirational scene that makes us cry together, proud to fight, to try every single day and do not give up. That scene was unforgettable.

        <p><strong>How is Ana today??</strong><br>

        Well, I know that reading numbers and achievements do not bring the real history and sometimes resume a lifetime of work in numbers. That is cold, poor and little. 
        I was zapping the television some years after that (yes, years) and in one of the channels I saw a woman on a suit, standing up behind what seemed to be a meeting table of a bit and important corporation and I recognized her. It was Ana. More impressive than that, reading the show name she was participating I was choked. It was the Brazilian version of The Apprentice.
        Well, ok, let us see more of that. In 30 minutes I was impressed again. She was serious but kind, confident but open, smart but humble, I needed to watch more. 
        I quickly went to the internet and found on YouTube the entire season to watch and that is what I did. From the beginning of the show to the end, she was brilliant and all I can say to prove that would be not enough.
        I was watching the show with the same enthusiasm I had for the games. Well, It was more than what I had for the games because there I could know another Ana. I learned there that from the period she retired from the games until now, Ana is working mainly on beneficent and social projects.  
        Ana founded IEE (Instituto Educação e Esporte), the Sport-Education institute. She is being working since there to develop children education through sports, teaching and bringing values like honesty, perseverance, ethics, democracy, humanism, and commitment to daily education, using the sport as an education instrument.
        There I could know another Ana and I invite you to know better her and her project too. 
        Ah, by the way. Ana won the show (why this is not a surprise?) and the 1 million Reais prize. The prize was donated to a Cerebral Palsy institute in Brazil (yes, not a surprise as well).
